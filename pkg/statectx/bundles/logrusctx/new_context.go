// NewContext is a simple-to-use function to create a context.Context
// using logrus as the logger.
//
// Note: the upstream "logrus" is in maintenance-mode.
// A quote from the README.md:
//
// > Logrus is in maintenance-mode. We will not be introducing new features.
// > It's simply too hard to do in a way that won't break many people's
// > projects, which is the last thing you want from your Logging library (again...).
// >
// > This does not mean Logrus is dead. Logrus will continue to be maintained
// > for security, (backwards compatible) bug fixes, and performance (where we
// > are limited by the interface).
// >
// > I believe Logrus' biggest contribution is to have played a part in today's
// > widespread use of structured logging in Golang. There doesn't seem to be
// > a reason to do a major, breaking iteration into Logrus V2, since the
// > fantastic Go community has built those independently. Many fantastic
// > alternatives have sprung up. Logrus would look like those, had it been
// > re-designed with what we know about structured logging in Go today.
// > Check out, for example, Zerolog, Zap, and Apex.
